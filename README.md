# funest
functional ensemble survival tree

sample training and validation datasets:
long_test.rda ; long_train.rda ; surv_test.rda ; surv_train.rda

training a funtional ensemble survival tree:
fit_fun.R

a possible assertion for fit_fun.R that can be used to tune the tree parameters:
fit_tune.R

to conduct dynamic predictions for a pre-trained model: 
fit_pred.R
